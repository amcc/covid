Graph of coronavirus daily deaths using UK gov data with @p5xjs: 

https://amcc.github.io/covid/



_I'm pretty sick of checking stats on complicated ugly pages._ They are often very hard to use on a mobile, not always the data you want. But the UK govenment page is actually clear and simple, plus they give you the JSON: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ 

**Give suggestions and I'll output the way you want - talk to me here: https://twitter.com/mcclymont**
